# vServer

I think this is the easiest setup. Basically, i followed [Gentoo's WireGuard docs](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Wireguard). The creation of key pairs and pre-shared keys have been shown in the [router docs](../router#create-wireguard-files). In the `etc` folder you can find my relevant config file and `firewall.sh` is my firewall configuration. Make sure to enable IPv4 forwarding.
